The following information can be stored:

- URL of the visited page.
- `Referer` header.
- Browser and system information (derived from `User-Agent` header or HTTP
  client hints; the original headers are not stored).
- Screen size.
- Country and region name derived from the IP address.
- The browser language derived from the `Accept-Language` header.

There is a setting to disable collecting any of this data and the collected data
may differ per hosted site, but the default is to collect all of the above
except the language.

No personal information (such as IP address) is collected; a hash of the IP
address, User-Agent, and a random number (“salt”) is kept in the process memory
for 8 hours to identify a browsing session, and is never stored to disk.

There is no information stored in the browser with cookies, localStorage, or
other methods.
