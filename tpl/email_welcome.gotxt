Welcome to your GoatCounter account!

Please go here to verify your email address:
{{.Site.URL .Context}}/user/verify/{{.User.EmailToken}}?email={{.User.Email | query_escape}}

Getting started is pretty easy, just add the following JavaScript anywhere on the page:

    <script data-goatcounter="{{.Site.URL .Context}}/count"
            async src="//{{.CountDomain}}/count.js"></script>

Don’t see any pageviews in your testing? This is probably because your adblocker is blocking GoatCounter – not much can (or should) be done about that on GoatCounter’s end.

Further documentation is available at {{.Site.URL .Context}}/code
